# movie-recommender
Bulit this project to find movies easier, since its diffuclt finding movies when there are so many options.

A Flask backend with React frontend to recommend movies using OpenAI and TMDB API as the movie database.

Why: I wanted to create something that would help me endlesses scroll on netflix, so I created a AI movie recommender. The AI will find a movie based on your prompt. 

So hopefully its a quicker way to find something to watch
